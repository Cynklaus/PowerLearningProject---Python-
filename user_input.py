# Create a new Python file and name it "user_input.py"

# Print out a personalized message using the user's name, age, and location. For example: "Hello [name], you are [age] years old and live in [location]."
# Save and run the program to see the output.

# Use the input() function to ask the user for their name and store it in a variable called "name".
name = input('What is your name? ') 

# Use the input() function to ask the user for their age and store it in a variable called "age".
age = input('What is your age? ')

# Use the input() function to ask the user for their location and store it in a variable called "location".
location = input('Where are you located? ') 

# Print out the result 
print(f'Hello {name}, you are {age} years old and live in {location}.')
